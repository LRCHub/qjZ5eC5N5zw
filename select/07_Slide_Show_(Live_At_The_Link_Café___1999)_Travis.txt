Today was the day
For dancing and for singing
The birds in the trees
And all the bells are ringing
The sun in the sky
Is bright, as bright as second sight
Is bright, oh God, I hope I'm alright
'Cause I'm gonna cry

Hold on, hold on
Slow down, slow down
You're out of touch
Out of touch

'Cause there is no design for life
There's no devil's haircut in my mind
There is not a wonderwall to climb
Or step around
But there is a slideshow and it's so slow
Flashing through my mind
Today was the day
But only for the first time

There is no design for life
There's no devil's haircut in your mind
There is not a wonderwall to climb
Or step around
Yet there is a slideshow and it's so slow
Flashing through your mind
Today is the day
But only for the first time
I hope it's not the last time
