The sea doesn't have to give a fuck to keep it's octopi alive
I'm too weird to be truly loved, a kiss from a nasty coroner
Simplicity posing as mutation

Take a photo of me losing stars while you say "kill yourself LOL"

Sessi all my thoughts are phantom pains that disappear just like a drowner's tears
Repeat the delete the sounding boy and as you are a fire sign
Electricity lies about a lot

Born to oblong confine acoustic "She", essential way of seeing women of doubt

You need to stop talking so you can start listening to yourself

We're not really living we'rе just surviving
Fear is made out of plastic it used to bе made out of glass
Become an acolyte and bite my temple
You need to stop talking
A kiss from a coroner it's listlessly working
Trolls on the dm saying "kill yourself lol" you kill myself lol
I'm a black widow and I don't bite you so I guess I'm in love
I must be in love
Screaming is just numbers when you scream I just see numbers
I slide off the Spectrum, lovers leap where edgelords fear to trend
Equatorial hemorrhage is a dead link
Be careful what you say to men, they're always recording
